            It was the year 2011, in my high school study hall class. My best friend kept talking about this new band called One Direction, and I asked who they were. She seemed shocked that I even asked who they were, but she immediately pulled up the music video for the song, What Makes You Beautiful. We probably watched the video 20 times, and that moment I knew I was a directioner. Up until that point,  had never been so obsessed with anything. They all had amazing voices, and to top It all off, they were all extremely handsome. Harry Styles was my favorite , and still is. I would stay up all night (Up All Night is the name of their first album, no pun intended) trying to enter all these contests to win backstage passes at their concert. Unfortunately never won anything, but I did get to go to their concert in 2012. Many tears were shed, and I probably lost my voice. I seriously thought Harry Styles would pick me out from the crowd and ask me to marry him. Lowkey still waiting for that happen... Although I am not as obsessive and weird about One Direction now, I will always hold a special place for them in my heart.
