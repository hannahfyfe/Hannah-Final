        I don't know about you, but I've been dying for One Direction to get back together. In March of 2015, Zayn Malik left the band. The four remaining members of the band released an album without Zayn, but later in the year broke up the band. Tragic, I know. One Directioners are a very persistent and nosy fandom, and recently they've been doing a lot of sleuthing. Liam Payne recently had an Interview with The Sun saying "We’ve got a 10-year anniversary coming up so we’ve all been speaking together a lot over the last few weeks which has been really nice." Obviously this has sparked a lot of curious directioners wondering if One Direction could be getting back together for their 10 year anniversary. If this Is actually In the works, I stan this. Fingers crossed directioners!
